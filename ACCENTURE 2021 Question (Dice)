1. Here you are given unbiased dice containing 6 faces. 
You have been  given a output sum which should be obtained by throwing two dice. 
You need to return all the possiblities where the sum on the both the dices are equal to output sum.     NOTE : A dice can be of 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 faces.
If there is no possiblities return 0.

INPUT 
10
OUTPUT
3

Solution : 

IN PYTHON
n = int(input())
count = 0
if n<=12 and n>=0:
    for i in range(1,7):
        for j in range(1,7):
            if i+j==n:
                count+=1
             
    print(count)         
else:
    print(0)
